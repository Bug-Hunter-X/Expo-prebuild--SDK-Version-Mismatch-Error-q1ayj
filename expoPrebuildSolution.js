The solution involves ensuring that your `app.json` (or `expo.json`) file's `expo.sdkVersion` matches both the EAS Build service's supported version and your locally installed Expo CLI's version. 

1. **Check EAS Build Compatibility:** Verify that your chosen `expo.sdkVersion` is supported by EAS Build. Refer to the EAS Build documentation for the latest compatible SDK versions.
2. **Update Expo CLI:**  Use `npm update -g expo-cli` or `yarn global upgrade expo-cli` to make sure your Expo CLI is up to date.
3. **Update app.json/expo.json:** Modify the `expo.sdkVersion` in your `app.json` or `expo.json` to align with the supported version. 
4. **Clean and Rebuild:** After making the version change, perform a clean rebuild by deleting the `node_modules` folder, running `expo prebuild --clean`, and then executing your usual build process.
5. **Retry the Build:** If the SDK version is mismatched, running the prebuild again will still cause error. If correctly configured, this will work!
