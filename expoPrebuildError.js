This error typically arises when using Expo's `expo prebuild` command, often in conjunction with EAS Build.  The core issue is a mismatch between the Expo SDK version specified in your app and the SDK version supported by the EAS Build service or your local Expo CLI environment.  The error message itself might not pinpoint the SDK version discrepancy directly but will indicate a failure during the prebuild process.
